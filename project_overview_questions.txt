1. Motivating Question: How would redefining St. Louis’s borders on density of census tract and remerging with St. Louis County affect the region?
    Sub Questions:
    To what extent does municipal reform in St. Louis align with the region’s innovation centers and activities?
    What demographic differences would arise and who may be left behind?
    How do per capita infrastructure assets change?
    What are potential savings from municipal consolidation in a ‘new’ St. Louis County?

2. Possible Datasets

    St. Louis Regional Data Exchange
        Transportation
        Human and Social Services
        Zoning
        Budget/Finance
        Taxes
        Public Safety and Justice

3. Ideas for Visualizations
Current and New Boundaries: 
    This is the starting point for the central idea of municipal consolidation. To understand the current situation two maps and summary statistics on the old and new boundaries will form the base of further analysis. Additionally, all visualization will likely include a side by side or at least one analysis under current and then the new proposed borders.
Municipal Comparison: 
    This chart will focus on the principal statistics regarding population and per capita spending on municipal services in St. Louis County compared to other peer cities suburbs. Peer cities will be defined by size, growth patterns, history, and geographic similarity.
Critical Infrastructure Overlay:
    This map will show the interconnection of items such as transit stops and centers. It will also include fire stations, police stations, department of transportation assets. This map might be toggleable to switch between these items then fire districts and policing zones (it will be complex looking due to current duplication of services and the overlay may not be possible all in one map).
Economic Cluster Overlay:
    This map will illustrate the current and proposed degree to which a redefined city would align with core economic strength centers of the St. Louis region. St. Louis’s clusters are AgTech & Plant Science, Logistics, and Medicine. This overlay may include a toggle for future cluster zones, principally in advanced manufacturing and/or geospatial technologies.
Municipal Finance Interaction:
    This will be an interactive table showing the relationships between different types of municiap aspects for the 93 (plus the county) municipaliities in the region to understand existing costs. Potentially using Louisville as a comparison.



Other Outlines: 
Desired Columns for census tract-level dataset:
    1. Total Population
    2. Median HHI
    3. Median HHI White
    4. Median HHI Black
    5. Median HHI All Other Races
    6. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'Less than High School'
    7. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'High School'
    8. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'Some College'
    8. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'Associate's Degree'
    9. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'Bachelor's Degree'
    10. Proportion Highest Level of Education column name: 'Master's Degree or Higher'
    11. Proportion White
    12. Proportion Black
    13. Proportion All Other Races
    14. Home Ownership Rate




✦ The outline provided in project_overview_questions.txt is highly feasible to implement, as much of the foundational data work and core analysis have already been completed.

  Current Progress vs. Proposed Outline


   1. Motivating Question & Redefining Borders:
       * Status: Implemented. data_cleaning_and_processing.py already defines the "New St. Louis" boundaries based on a density threshold (>= 3,600 people/sq mi) and manual adjustments 
         for contiguity.
       * Demographics: Implemented. The script pulls ACS 2023 data (HHI, Race, Education, Home Ownership) and joins it with census tracts, allowing for immediate side-by-side comparison
         of old vs. new borders.


   2. Innovation Centers & Economic Clusters:
       * Status: Highly Feasible. You have stl_innovation_geo.csv containing coordinates for Start-Up Spaces, Innovation Districts (Cortex, 39 North), and Universities.
       * Next Step: Overlay these points onto the "New St. Louis" GeoJSON to see how well the new borders capture these economic drivers.


   3. Critical Infrastructure Overlay:
       * Status: Highly Feasible. Your raw-data folder already contains GeoJSONs for:
           * Transit: routes_bus, routes_metro, stations_bus, stations_metro.
           * Public Safety: police.geojson, stl_firestat.geojson, stlc_firedist.geojson.
       * Next Step: Combine these layers in a Folium map (as hinted at in exploration.py) to visualize service density and potential duplication.


   4. Municipal Comparison & Finance:
       * Status: Partially Implemented.
           * generate_muni_csv.py has already created a governance dataset (muni_governance_merged.csv) with population and payroll costs for 90+ municipalities.
           * exploration.py includes a FISC (Fiscally Standardized Cities) debt comparison with peer cities like Kansas City, Nashville, and Columbus.
       * Next Step: Use the per-capita administrative costs in your governance CSV to model potential savings from consolidation (e.g., "What if the 93 municipalities shared a single   
         administrative structure?").


  Immediate Next Steps to Complete the Vision
   * Refine the "Innovation" Map: Plot the assets from stl_innovation_geo.csv using Folium markers.
   * Infrastructure Analysis: Calculate the count of transit stations and fire stations per capita for the "Old City" vs. "New City."
   * Louisville Comparison: If you wish to use Louisville as a model for consolidation, you would need to add its FISC data to your debt/finance plots in exploration.py.
